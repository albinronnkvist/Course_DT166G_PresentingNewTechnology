# DT166G - Presenting New Technology

A literature review and presentation on hybrid search, combining semantic search with keyword-based search, supported by statistical methods.

In this course, I have developed skills in scientific methodology and academic writing, including exploring research trends in computer science, analyzing scientific literature, and adhering to guidelines for conducting and reporting research. As part of the course, I conducted a focused [study on hybrid search](https://github.com/albinronnkvist/Course_DT166G_PresentingNewTechnology/blob/main/Literature/LiteratureReview/LiteratureReview.pdf), combining semantic and keyword-based search, and implemented a [custom solution](https://github.com/albinronnkvist/Course_DT166G_PresentingNewTechnology/tree/main/HybridSearch). In addition, the course covered statistics, including formulating hypotheses, understanding significance levels, comparing two means, analyzing correlations, and other foundational statistical methods. I implemented these techniques in R and applied them in my research.
